 In step one I created a Record Data Class and gave it attributs 'sender', 'receiver', and 'amount'. In step two I modified the existing Block class to reflect Record instead of data: Any. This was added to the existing code from class. In step three I set up the streamlit interface. I deleted the input_data variable and added new text entry fields for 'sender', 'receiver', and 'amount'. I also added record to the Add Block button section. Finally I tested the code. Here is a screenshot of the chain with 'record' field:
